# MOSAIC OMNeT++ Federate

## Using OMNeT++ 6.1 with the MOSAIC Federate

The [packaging_script](package_federate.sh) can be used to package the current state of this repositories code and copy it to the desired destination, so that it can be used in conjunction with the **install** script of Eclipse MOSAIC.

## Install/Build Dependencies

The omnetpp-federate has the following dependencies:

- `protobuf`
- `gtest`
- `inet` (tested with version `4.5.4`)
- `omnetpp` (tested with version `6.1`) for dependencies on your system please refer to [Install guide](https://doc.omnetpp.org/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf)
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (For installing Python deps needed for omnetpp and inet)
- `python3-dev`

In the case of Ubuntu system these commands **should** take care of installing the needed packages:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config ccache clang curl lld gdb bison flex perl python3 python3-pip python3-venv libpython3-dev libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev doxygen graphviz xdg-utils libdw-dev
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
## Usage

```bash
./package_federate.sh mosaic_install_folder/bin/fed/omnetpp
```

## Changelog

This is a summary of the recent changes on this branch:

- **Features**
  - Added `package_federate.sh` script to easily package the federate for Eclipse MOSAIC.
  - Updated the federate code to be compatible with `simu5` requirements, including INET package structure updates and migration to C++17 standard.
- **Fixes**
  - Corrected the creation of RSU and vehicle vectors and fixed default routing issues.
  - Reverted a change in include order that was causing compilation errors.
- **Configuration**
  - Had to change the communicationCache `ReferenceCommunicationCache` to avoid vector bound errors
- **Documentation**
  - Added instructions on how to use the `package_federate.sh` script.
  - Updated dependency versions to `inet-4.5.4` and `omnetpp-6.1`.



<!-- This repository provides code to integrate the [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) network simulator with the Mobility Simulation Framework [Eclipse MOSAIC](https://github.com/eclipse/mosaic). The federate is a wrapper around OMNeT++ and the [INET](https://inet.omnetpp.org/) framework and provides a socket-based communication between this federate and the `OmnetppAmbassador`, thus enabling a coupling between those two tools.

The federate can be build using the `omnet_installer.sh` script which is bundled with each Eclipse MOSAIC distribution. See [MOSAIC's website](https://www.eclipse.org/mosaic/docs/simulators/network_simulator_omnetpp/) for additional and detailed instructions.

The subsequent instructions therefore adresses advanced users who want to alter the source code of the federate. If you just want to use the coupling between MOSAIC and OMNeT++, you can use the `omnet_installer.sh` script.

## Install/Build Dependencies

The omnetpp-federate has the following dependencies:

* `protobuf`
* `gtest`
* `inet` (tested with version `4.5.4`, but see notes below for OMNeT++ 6.1 compatibility)
* `omnetpp` (tested with version `6.1`)

Building omnetpp-federate requires further dependencies:

* `premake`
* `premake-autoconf`

The source code and binary tar balls for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X of ```premake``` are available at https://premake.github.io/download.html.
When you choose the binary version then the tar ball extracts just one single binary called ```premake5``` for direct use. Please keep in mind that ```premake``` is
written as a c-binding to a modified variant of ```lua``` that is statically linked in. The currently (```premake5-alpha12```) linked in ```lua``` version is ```5.3``` which should be considered when placing extensions of ```premake```.

The building of ```premake5``` from source for linux is strait forward and is done with ```GNU make```.

```bash
~$ make -f Bootstrap.mak linux
~# cp bin/release/premake5 /usr/local/bin
```

The second dependency ```premake5-autoconf``` can be downloaded from https://github.com/Blizzard/premake-autoconf.git.
It consists of a flat directory of ```lua``` files. These can be directly placed in the ```omnet-federate``` build directory or
in a directory your ```premake5``` can find it. Usually it will show the search directories that is looking into for modules when a module was not found, i.e. ```/usr/local/share/lua/5.3/```. The ```premake5-autoconf``` module introduces support for ```autoconf``` style checks for headers and libraries and, and full ```clang``` support.

Ubuntu 16.04 xenial users can use a package from "PPA for Paul McEnery", see https://launchpad.net/~pmcenery/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+packages?field.name_filter=premake&field.status_filter=published&field.series_filter=.

## Build from ```MOSAIC``` source

```bash
~$ premake5 gmake
~$ make config=debug clean # config=release
~$ make config=debug # config=release
```

Some source file are generated by the OMNeT++ message compiler or the protobuf compiler. To regenerate these files
pass the options ```--generate-opp-messages``` and/or ```--generate-protobuf```. The regeneration is done during ```make```.

## Install from ```MOSAIC``` source

To trigger the install target pass ```--install``` to ```premake5``` and run ```make``` as super user.

```bash
~$ premake5 gmake --install
~# make config=debug clean
~# make config=debug
```

## Run

To run ```omnetpp-federate``` with NED files specify the NED root source folder:

```bash
~$ /usr/bin/omnetpp-federate -n /usr/share/ned omnetpp.ini
```

Otherwise, if there are multiple directories then you can specify the NED source directories by setting the environment variable ```NEDPATH```.

```bash
~$ export NEDPATH="/usr/include/inet:/usr/share/ned"
~$ /usr/bin/omnetpp-federate
``` -->
